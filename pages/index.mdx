# Custom Workflows
What would you do if you could write your own workflow?

## Introduction

Custom Workflows is a robust feature designed to supercharge the customization and automation of your calendaring experience.
Like other TimeTo Workflows, they operate on your connected calendars.
Enabling visibility on your events, meetings, and scheduled tasks.

But here's the twist: Custom Workflows hand over the reins to you.

They are blank canvases, you can write your own code, automate your O365/Google/Slack via our dedicated APIs, and integrate it with third-party apps.

Even though you design them, we ensure they run seamlessly, just like any other workflow on our platform.
Once created it will run reacting to calendar updates, or you can launch your workflow manually from the platform or externally.

Here are some examples of what you can implement:
- 🤖 Fancy auto-scheduling tasks for tomorrow using your third-party task manager? You can schedule tasks aligned with your upcoming availability.
- 💬 Dream of a Slack notification for every invite from VIP email addresses? We've got you.
- 🚫 Don't want meetings at certain times or days? Auto-decline them.
- 💌 How about a Friday roundup? Make your team aware of meeting hours from the past week slacking them directly any relevant stats.
- 🚀 Release something? Trigger directly from the deployment script the workflow to set an auto-reminder for your analyst 3 days later, ensuring they peek at the metrics.

## Create your first Custom Workflow

<Steps>
    ### Sign in to TimeTo:

    Create a new account or sign in to [TimeTo](https://platform.morgen.so/dashboard).
    If you already have a Morgen account, you can use it to sign in to TimeTo.

    ### Connect your calendars:
    Before proceeding to create Custom Workflows, ensure that you've connected the calendar accounts you wish to control. This ensures your workflow has the visibility and permissions it needs.


    ### Navigate to Workflows Gallery:
    In the workflows gallery, you'll find the Custom Workflow together with the other workflows. Click on create or go directly to the [Custom Workflow](https://platform.morgen.so/workflows/custom-workflow/new) create page.

    ### Create a new Custom Workflow:
    Here you can create a new Custom Workflow, you can:
    - Choose a name for your workflow.
    - Choose the calendar you want to trigger the workflow. When any event is added/updated/removed, the workflow will run.
    - Select the calendars you want control over within your script.
    - Provide your own script to run when the workflow is triggered.
</Steps>

## Next Steps

Now that you've got the basics down, check out the more advanced examples below
or check out the documentation on the [Morgen API](/sync-events).

## Data types
Here are some data types you will use to:

### Trigger Data
The `trigger` argument is always passed to your script when the workflow is triggered.
```js
async function run(trigger) {
  const {
    // Changes to the specified calendar since the previous trigger
    // Each field is an array of Event[]
    eventUpdates: { added, removed, updated },
    accounts: {
      // An array of calendars provided by workflow configuration
      // E.g. [{accountId: "...", calendarId: "..."}]
      calendar,
    },
    // Your user object
    user: {
      // The primary email address associated with your account
      email,
      // Your first name
      firstName
    },
    tokens
  } = trigger;

  ...
}
```

### Event from `eventUpdates`
The event object returned from `eventUpdates`.
See the [JSCalendar docs](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc8984.html) for details.

    }
  }
```

## Utilities
Here are some utility functions you can use in your custom workflow scripts:

### Wrapper for fetching Morgen APIs
This wrapper will make it easier to make requests to Morgen APIs using the [`fetch` interface](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Fetch_API).
It uses the global `TOKEN` variable, which stores your own personal access token to make calls to our API.
You can use this to make requests to either `https://sync.morgen.so` for fetching/updating calendar events or interacting with your other accounts, or `https://api.morgen.so` for anything specific to Morgen itself, like tasks.

```js
async function fetchMorgen(url, opts) {
  return fetch(
    url,
    {
      headers: {
        Authorization: `Bearer ${JSON.parse(global.TOKEN)}`,
        Accept: 'application/json',
        ["Content-Type"]: 'application/json',
        ...opts.headers,
      },
      ...opts,
    }
  );
}
```

### Get a ChatGPT prompt response
The code snippet below demonstrates how to use the `getOpenAIResponse` function to generate chat responses using the OpenAI API. Before using this code, make sure you have your `OpenAI API token`.
```js
async function getOpenAIResponse(prompt) {
  const resp = fetch(
    "https://api.openai.com/v1/chat/completions",
    {
      method: 'POST',
      headers: {
        Authorization: 'Bearer [YOUR-TOKEN]',
        Accepts: 'application/json',
        'Content-Type': 'application/json',
      },
      body: JSON.stringify({
        "model": "gpt-3.5-turbo",
        "messages": [{
          "role": "user",
          "content": prompt
        }],
        "temperature": 0.7
      })
    }
  )
  const parsed = JSON.parse(resp);
  if (parsed.error) {
    throw new Error('Error with OpenAI: ' + JSON.stringify(parsed.error));
    return;
  }
  return parsed.choices[0].message.content;
}
```

## Custom Workflows Examples
Here are some examples of custom workflows that you can create:

### Create an Event via Morgen API
The following code snippet shows how to use the `fetchMorgen` utility to create a new event using the Morgen API.

```js
async function fetchMorgen(url, opts) { ... } // See Utilities: Wrapper for fetching Morgen APIs

async function run(trigger) {
  const calId = trigger.accounts.calendar[0].calendarId;
  const resp = await fetchMorgen("https://sync.morgen.so/v1/events/create", {
    method: 'POST',
    body: JSON.stringify({
      calendarId: calId,
      title: 'My New Event',
      description: '#automated',
      start: "2023-08-25T13:00:00",
      timeZone: "UTC",
      showWithoutTime: false,
      duration: "PT1H"
    })
  })

  log('Response received: ' + JSON.stringify(resp, null, 2));
}
```

### Send a Slack Message
The following code snippet shows how to receive a Slack message when something changes in your calendar.
```js
 async function run(trigger) {
    const slackToken = "xorb-[your slack bot access token]";
    const resp = await fetch(
      "https://api.slack.com/api/chat.postMessage", {
      method: 'POST',
      headers: {
        Authorization: `Bearer ${slackToken}`,
        Accept: 'application/json',
        ["Content-Type"]: 'application/json',
      },
      body: JSON.stringify({
        channel: '@Luke',
        text: 'Hi there, something changed in your calendar!'
      })
    }
  );
}
```

### Custom Workflow: Generate event descriptions using ChatGPT
The following code snippet shows how to use the `fetchMorgen` and `getOpenAIResponse` to put ChatGPT to work on your newly created events.

It uses the prompt _"Write a movie trailer script for a movie of this title"_ to write a new event description via ChatGPT, and passes the result to the event update API.

```js
async function fetchMorgen(url, opts) { ... } // See Utilities: Wrapper for fetching Morgen APIs
async function getOpenAIResponse(prompt) { ... } // See Utilities: Get a ChatGPT prompt response

async function run(trigger) {
  const calId = trigger.accounts.calendar[0].calendarId;

  log(trigger);

  // Only process newly added events - ignore updates.
  // NOTE: Important to ignore the calendar update later in the script
  if (trigger.eventUpdates.modified.length > 0) {
    return;
  }

  // Get the first added event that hasn't been processed previously (ignore the rest)
  const addedEvent = trigger.eventUpdates.added[0];

  // Generate a description using the title of the event
  const title = addedEvent.title;
  const description = await getOpenAIResponse("Write a movie trailer script for a movie of this title: " + title);

  // Update the event via the Morgen API
  const resp = await fetchMorgen("https://sync.morgen.so/v1/events/update", {
    method: 'POST',
    body: JSON.stringify({
      id: addedEvent.id,
      calendarId: calId,
      title,
      description,
    })
  })

  log('Event updated: ' + JSON.stringify(resp, null, 2));
}

```
