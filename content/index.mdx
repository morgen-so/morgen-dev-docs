## What can you build?

The Morgen API provides a unified interface to interact with calendars and tasks across multiple providers. Here's what you can do:

### 📅 Calendar Events

Create, read, update, and delete events across all connected calendar accounts. The API supports:

- **Recurring events** with flexible recurrence rules
- **Attendees and invitations** with participation status
- **Virtual meeting rooms** (Google Meet, Microsoft Teams, Zoom, Webex)
- **Reminders and alerts** customization
- **All-day and timed events** with timezone support

### ✅ Tasks

Manage Morgen tasks programmatically—ideal for automations and integrations:

- Create, update, and organize tasks
- Set due dates, priorities, and estimated durations
- Build subtask hierarchies
- Mark tasks as complete or reopen them

### 🔗 Integrations

Access all calendar accounts connected to a user's Morgen account:

- **Google Calendar** and **Microsoft 365**
- **iCloud**, **Fastmail**, and **CalDAV** providers
- **Calendar feeds** (read-only subscriptions)
- **Video conferencing** services (Zoom, Webex)
